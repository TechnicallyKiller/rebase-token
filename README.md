# CROSS-CHAIN REBASE TOKEN
1. Create a protocol that allows user to deposit in a vault and in return, They recieve rebase tokens that represent underlying balance
2. Rebase Token -> balanceOf function is dynamic to show the changing balance with time,
    -Balance increases linearly with time
    - mint tokens to our users everytime they perform an action (minting, burning , transferring or bridging)
3. Interest rate 
    -Indiviually set interest rate or each user based on global interest rate at the protocol at the time
    -  this global interest rate can only decrease to incetivise reward early adopters.
